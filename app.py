# print(phrase.upper())  # This is how to convert a string to upper case
# print(phrase.isupper())  # This is how to check if a string is upper case
# print(phrase.upper().isupper())  # This is how to check if a string is upper case
# print(len(phrase))  # This is how to get the length of a string
# print(phrase[0])  # This is how to get the first character of a string (0 based index)
# print(phrase.index("G"))  # This is how to get the index of first occurrence of a character
# print(phrase.index("Acad"))  # This is how to get the index of first occurrence of a sequence of characters
# print(phrase.replace("Giraffe", "Elephant"))  # This is how to replace a string with another string
